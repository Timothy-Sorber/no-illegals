# no-illegals
A skript that prevents the use of illegal items.

Just upload it to the "scripts" folder inside of the "skript" folder in your server.
(you need skript for this to work at all)
This is mainly useful for dupe servers, as they can give a player an illegal item, so now they can't use it.

Prevents:
1. barriers
2. bedrock
3. spawn eggs
4. structure void
5. structure block
6. end portal frames
